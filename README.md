# Project motivation 
We chose this dataset because heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, and early detection can save lives. This dataset includes important health factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and exercise symptoms, which are crucial for predicting heart disease. By using this data, we aim to build a classification model that can help identify people at risk, allowing for timely interventions and better management of heart health. Additionally, clustering techniques could be applied to group individuals with similar health profiles, which could reveal patterns or risk factors not immediately apparent. This project not only gives us a chance to apply machine learning techniques like classification and clustering to a real-world problem but also helps address a significant health issue that affects millions of people worldwide.
